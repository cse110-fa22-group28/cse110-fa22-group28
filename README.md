## Project Description

Welcome to the repository for the [Stonks Chore Tracker](https://stonks-chore-tracker.netlify.app/)! Our chore tracker is an **easy-to-use** app that helps you keep track of all your chores. Our app is also **accessible**, as it's been designed to work on most devices (computers, phones, tablets, etc).

Our app offers the following features:

- _Scheduling_: You have the ability to schedule which day to complete each chore. (No more saying "I'll do it later" and then forgetting about your chores for a month.)
- _Prioritization_: Our app automatically sorts your chores, such that the ones you need to complete sooner are always at the top of the list.
- _Task Assignment_: You can also specify an assignee for each chore, making it easier to divide work amongst your roommates.

Make sure to check out our [videos](./admin/videos) to see a demo of the app. Or, jump right in and test the app yourself! The app is live at [https://stonks-chore-tracker.netlify.app/](https://stonks-chore-tracker.netlify.app/)
