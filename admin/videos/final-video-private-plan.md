    - Problem: Repo organization issues
      - Some repo disorganization (artifacts from old sprints)
      - Should have emphasized code pushing and branching rules earlier to prevent merge conflicts and better keep track of progress
    - Victory: repo is in majority maintainable
    - Problem: Lack of guidance near start b/c we weren't sure how much work we would be able to do and how to organize tasks most efficiently
    - Solution: We got a good idea on how to perform tasks efficiently and give good guidelines
      - Everyone was participating at the end, and integration got better over time
    - Problem: Technical debt, focused on finishing MVP over enforcing docs and unit tests
    - Solution: We were able to pull through and provide thorough tests and documentation
    - Problem: Lack of complexity and features in our app compared to other teams
    - Explanation: Our team's focus was mainly solidifying our organizational and administrative practices, although we maybe should have focused more on adding features
    - Victory: Despite lack of features, app is accessible on any device and it's easy to use
