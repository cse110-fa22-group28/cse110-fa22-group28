## Discussion

- Discussed pitch draft and different features in details.
- Design a prototype of UI by drawing it;we can make it in Figma later(Justin-designer)
- main screen: modules of chores for different sections with unique icons(just like gihub issues)
  - On each bars: avators of assignee; name of chores, due date.
  - Bars themselves are progression bar; once finished there'll be check marks and confetti.
- Add chores feartures: pop-up windows, blurred backgrounds
- info on each chores modules when we click them: took pictures already
- Everyone needs to always be in sync with others; meeting to assign tasks and do coding individually.
- Start to make up persona, user story and user cases.
  - differences between user story and user cases: story is more about someone using the app, cases are more about specific features.
- Look into the link of introducing persona, user story, and user cases
