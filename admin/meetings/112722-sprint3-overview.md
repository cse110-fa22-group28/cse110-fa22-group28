## Discussion

- Assignments coming up
  - 2 videos
    - Team status 2: should be similar to team status 1, but we'll just do a screen recording instead of any elaborate acting
    - Public final video: we'll put more effort into this one. **This video will be shown in class and be voted on, so it is super important**
    - Final video will probably be more technical
  - Will be having a code freeze **likely starting on Friday, Dec 2** to work on the final video
  - **Final interview**
    - Know the entire codebase
    - Gagan will interview each of us to see how much of the code base each person knows
    - Might be a few questions about the class in general
    - **Might possibly all meet to discuss what each of us has done and write it out**
- Testing
  - Will need to implement unit tests + end-to-end (E2E) tests
  - Based on Lab 8
  - Unit tests should be quick, E2E Tests will be more complex but will not have too many of these
  - Unit tests should be done by whoever has written the specific part of the code
  - CI/CD automation included
- Tasks we need to do
  - Unit and E2E testing
  - Documentation for HTML, CSS
  - CI automation for testing, doc generation
  - Styling Updates (Make chore card more compact, add animation, etc.)
  - Cleanup (e.g. linting fixes)
- Nice to have features
  - Edit feature for chore cards
  - Ability to click on chore card to see extra info
  - Extra sorting features (allow for user defined priority)
  - Persistent storage
- **Features we for sure will implement**
  - Assignee avatar
  - Voted on implementing edit button + other priority sorting
