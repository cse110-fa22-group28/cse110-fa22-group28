## Agenda

- Writing code skeleton of main page of the chore app.

## Discussion

- We discussed what should be displayed in the homepage of our chore app. We referred to the app's UI design and its functions, and decided to add 'menu' and 'add chore' buttons inside header and footer respectively. We discussed about whether to add img src for the buttons but we concluded that it should be done when we're doing CSS.
