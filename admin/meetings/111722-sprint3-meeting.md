## Discussion
Team Status Video due soon, at most 4 minutes long
Choosing video director
Story based i.e roommate having trouble with chores then we come in with suits to present app
Infomercial

Issues will be broken up into smaller parts
MVP is priority

Keep in mind to review the extensive function descriptions in announcements
These are precursors for documentation
Finalize documentation and unit tests before creating functions and writing rest of code
Need to keep in mind that code needs to have linting errors fixed

JSON, local storage, and UI must be able to communicate with eachother
Local storage should be treated as RAM not persistent storage, JSON acts as a hard drive/persistent storage
Persistence is not yet set to use JSON files, may use indexdb or mysql

Everyone will be split into two teams, one team for UI integration and the other for unit tests and main.js coding
