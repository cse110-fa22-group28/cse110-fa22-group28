## Agenda
Use super linter to lint required files

## Discussion
* [GitHub Super Linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter)
* Basic functionality simple to set up, just use package as a step in a job
* To persist logs in the repository, must move automatically generated log file in the virtual environment into desired location then add to repo
* By default, will parse all types of files which increases the run time, by specifying a file type to parse using VALIDATE_HTML environment variable will automatically turn off all other checks
* Beware of using youtube tutorials for further investigation into super linker as many of them use deprecated functionality
