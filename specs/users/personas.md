Quote: “Can you repeat this again for me?”<br>
<br>
Short Description:
Kentucky is an old man trying to remember everything but in most cases, he fails. Because he is not good at using new technology like smartphones, so he is limited to using the reminder apps developed by other companies since they are too complicated.
He needs someone to remind him what chores he has to do today.
This app will help him because the app itself is easy for everyone to use (that is, it is very user-friendly.) He also needs a chores app including a reminder system to let him know what he has to do for today (like what food he has to buy, does he need to sweep/mop the floor?).
