## Kentucky Grandpa's Coffee Conundrum

As usual, Kentucky gets up bright and early and shuffles into the kitchen to make his cup of coffee. As he sips some hot java, he sits in front of his computer to check if he's gotten any new messages from his family. (It's a bad habit to look at a screen so early, but looks like everyone's been doing it lately. Kentucky doesn't want to be left out.) Suddenly he gets a notification: Your "Clean Coffee Machine" chore is due today! *Oh, I had completely forgotten*, thinks Kentucky. He clicks navigates to his chore app and looks at the top of the chore list, where he sees that he indeed needs to clean his coffee machine today. Kentucky gets up from his computer and walks over to get this chore over with... only to realize that he's also forgotten how to clean the coffee machine. (The last time he did it was 3 months ago.) Unpreturbed, he confidently walks back to his computer and clicks on the associated chore card. A pop up appears, on which is a handy list of instructions and materials needed to make his coffee machine sparkling clean! He gets what he needs and follows the steps carefully, and within 15 minutes he's done!

# General User Stories for the Chore Tracker

## User Story 1: The Roommate

As a college roommate, Amanda Fish, I want to hold myself and my roommates accountable for doing chores to ensure that our apartment remians clean. This is difficult for us since we are not able to get together and keep each other accountable on a daily basis due to our busy and highly incompatibel schedules.

Technical abstarction of problem:

The app needs to:
  1. Assign chores to roommates without hassle
  2. Allow people in the house to view each others chores' and completion status


## User Story 2: Busy Working Professional

As a busy working professional, I, Lily Worker, want to schedule my time for doing chores and always remember them so my children are able to live in a clean and organised home.
Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go thorugh a long task creation process so I just try to remeber my chores rather then scheduling them which usually doesn't work.
I want a app so that I can quickly plan my chores without wasting much time doing this planning.

Technical abstraction of problem:

The app needs to:
  1. Allow users to schedule chores with few operations in a streamlines interface

## User Story 3: Forgetful Person

As someone who needs to be reminded to do even the most basic things while I am engrossed in my video games, I, Luke Lazy, need an app to remind me to do my chores before their deadline. WIth no time pressure, I will never do my chores. Also, I hate chores and will never assign anything to myself but my parents want me to help around the house.

Technical Abstraction of problem:

The app needs to:
  1. Remind users to complete their scheduled chores as their deadline approaches
  2. Allow users to assign tasks to each other

## User Story 4: Non-technical individual

Technology is confusing. I, Kentucky Grandpa, grew up when things were simple and we used to write our chores on post-its and notebooks - sometimes even whiteboards. There were no buttons, lists with a billion options or long forms to fill out to plan tasks. However, no-one wants to use paper anymore and I can't keep track of all this paper anymore - I keep losing it.
I need an app to store my chores but I don't want to be confused whenever I open it.

Technical Abstraction of the problem:

The App needs to:
  1. Have a simple to use, streamlined interface with minimal unnecessary options
  2. Store chores persitently such that they don't need to be re-entered multiple times.

## User Story 5: Adulting

I have never done chores before, I don't know how to do them! My parents sued to handle most things for me and give me detailed instructions whenever tehy asked me to do any chores but now I am lost with no guidance. I don't know what to do, youtube videos have been helpful but I can't keep earching them up.

Technical Abstraction of Problem:

The app needs to:
  1. Have a preloaded set of basic chores with instuctions that users can use
