# Decision on what framework to use for our Application

## Context and Problem Statement

Upon deciding that a web application needs to be built, we had to decide what web framework we will be using for our application since there are multiple options available to us.
These were decided in the project constraints but this document record why this choice was beneficial for our project.

## Decision Drivers

* Primary Driver: Contraint placed on the project by the Instructional Team
* Secondary Driver: Experience levels of team members with specific web infrastructures.

## Considered Options

* Standard Web-stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
* React

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: {Standard Web-stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript)}
- Primarily due to this being the only option available to us after constraints were imposed
- All team members either had experience with this or would be able to learn these languages through the class labs
- Time saved in learning the other frameworks could be devoted to developing our application and more structured planning for the best outcome at the end of the project

### Consequences

* Good, because all members will be on the same skill level with the chosen framework after completing class labs which makes dividing tasks more effective
* Bad, because it limits advanced features other frameworks provide. However, this is not a significant drawback as the project does not require these advanced features.

## Validation

* For each page branch pull request; HTML validators, JS Unit tests, and JSDocs generators will be run.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Standard Web-stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript)

* Good, because all members will learn the skills required to develop software with these languages through the class labs. We will not need to spend time learning these languages from scratch
* Good, because the framework is very barebones with minimal complexities that are not required for our project making development more streamlined and less prone to failure
* Good, because the TA mentor will be able to provide more detailed feedback and support
* Good, because we will not be violating the constraints imposed on the project for this quarter

* Neutral, because we are limited in terms of advanced application features. However, we do not plan to use these in our application anyway

### React

* Good, because the framework provides more advanced design features to design rich user interfaces
* Good, because it will be a good addition to our resumes

* Neutral, because it provides fast template designing to save time though this will probably not be used in our project

* Bad, because it is based on many 3rd party libraries which adds too many dependencies to our code
* Bad, because very few developer conventions are imposed which could lead to bad/unreadable code
* Bad, because this will violate the constraints placed on the projects
